Hey there, I'm Max and love chatting about all things Computer Vision, Graphics and generally all things Computer Science 💻!

I'm currently interning at [DisneyResearch|Studios](https://studios.disneyresearch.com/) in Zürich working on movie magic using computer vision.
During my Master's Degree in Robotics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) I did my thesis on extracting pixel-level details with artist friendly meshes from images.
Before that, I did my undergraduate degree in Computer Science at [TUM](https://tum.de), where I worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicles.

Additionally, I've tutored students in various lectures, worked on 3D rendering in the advertising industry, and am an [avid road cyclist](fun/cycling.jpg)
