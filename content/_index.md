Currently I'm doing my Master's degree in Robotics at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch) where I'm focussing on robot navigation and planning for autonomous systems.

In the past, I've worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicles at I6@TUM and did my Bachelor's thesis there. You can check it out here. Additionally, I've tutored students at both TUM and HdM and worked on 3D Rendering in the advertising industry. If you're interested to learn more, hit me up via Email.

Mandelbrot was developed during a two semester Project at the CAPS chair of TUM. It shows the possible speedup which can be achieved by parallelization on a cluster of independent compute nodes.
