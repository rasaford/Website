## Self-Introduction

Currently I'm doing my Master's degree in Robotics at ETH Zurich where I'm focussing on robot navigation and planning for autonomous systems. 

In the past, I've worked on motion planning for autonomous vehicles at
[I6 @ TUM](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i06/home/) and did my Bachelor's thesis there. 
You can check it out [here]({{< ref "/posts/scenario-generation.md" >}} "Scenario Generation").
Additionally, I've tutored students at both TUM and HdM and worked on 3D Rendering in the advertising industry.
