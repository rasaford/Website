## Self-Introduction

Currently, my main focus is theoretical concepts in the space of autonomous vehicles, 
which I am working on at [I6 @ TUM](https://www.in.tum.de/en/i06/home/).

In the past I've done some teaching for Tutorials at TUM and HdM and worked on 3D Rendering in the advertising industry.
